    Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general <br> gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle <br> royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like <br> creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.

Save the World <br> and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on <br> December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful <br> for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less <br> than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated <br> $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019.
